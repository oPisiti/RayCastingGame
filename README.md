# RayTracing

A game based on ray casting that got a bit out of hand

## Usage

Just clone the repo and open `index.html`.

WASD is used for walking and the arrow keys left and right move the camera. Space jumps.

The slider on the bottom left corner adjusts the FOV on the fly.

## Shooter variation

The `Shooter` branch enables a mode in which the left mouse button shoots a light beam.

Such beam bounces of the walls and illuminates them for the player.
